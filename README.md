##Self Assesment

I began the computer science program at SNHU in August of 2021, I had no experience with programming prior to this. I found this program to be very challenging at times but also very rewarding offering me the opportunities to improve and develop many new skills
        such as attention-to-detail, research, and problem solving. My first course in the program was Introduction to Scripting using Python, this was extremely challenging as I was learning many new concepts specifically decision brancing and while loops, in the course I was tasked
        with creating a basic text based adventure game. I spent hours trying to understand how to properly work the if statements and loop termination. The next class was Intro to App Development with Java by this point decision branching and while loops were easy but now I had for loops to deal with, next was 
        my first C++ class with an introduction to data structures at which point I felt like a professional with loops and decision branching. Basically throughout the program each class offered a new challenge by the time I reached it I had overcome the previous challenge, the program really excelled at scaffolding 
        my learning always giving me a new challenge but ensuring I had the skills necessary to overcome the challenge.
