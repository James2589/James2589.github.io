# ePortfolio

## Self Assesment

Hello my name is James and this is my ePortfilio. This ePortfolio showcases my growth and development throughout my studies in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).
This ePortfolio contains artifacts I created throughout my time in the program followed with enhanced versions of the artifacts to showcase my growth in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

I began the computer science program at SNHU in August of 2021, I had no experience with programming prior to this. I found this program to be very challenging at times but also very rewarding offering me the opportunities to improve and develop many new skills
such as attention-to-detail, research, and problem solving. My first course in the program was Introduction to Scripting using Python, this was extremely challenging as I was learning many new concepts specifically decision brancing and while loops, in the course I was tasked
with creating a basic text based adventure game. I spent hours trying to understand how to properly work the if statements and loop termination. The next class was Intro to App Development with Java by this point decision branching and while loops were easy but now I had for loops to deal with, next was my first C++ class with an introduction to data structures at which point I felt like a professional with loops and decision branching. Basically throughout the program each class offered a new challenge by the time I reached it I had overcome the previous challenge, the program really excelled at scaffolding my learning always giving me a new challenge but ensuring I had the skills necessary to overcome the challenge. 


## Software Design & Engineering

The original artifact was a basic console application built using C++ to calculate the growth of a savings account. The app includes functions to manipulate and access the properties necessary to complete the calculations. While the enhanced version of the application
was also created using C++ it was converted into a WinForms application with the addition of a user interface opposed to the original console based application.


## Algorithm and Data Structures

The original artifact was a Python Dash application using a MongoDB database that stored animal shelter data to search for search and rescue candidates. During the enhancement I used numerous ArrayLists to store the returned data from the database and user input data to add to 
the database, I also used JavaFX's observable ArrayLists to then display the information.


## Databases

I used the same artifact from Algorithms and Data Structures for this category because in the original artifact I was supplied with a database, but no longer had access to this database. This gave me an opportunity in the enhancement to create my own database using MongoDB
and to use MongoDB Compass as a method to easily test and manage my database. The use of this tool offered me the opportunity to see results in real time and became a great learning tool.
